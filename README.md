# Interaction Lab Examples

This repository contains lesson plans and example code for Fall 2020 Interaction Lab at NYUSH IMA.

The sample code demonstrates fine-grained progressions, that change one thing at a time. In class, I typically start from a blank sketch or from the first sketch in a progression, and edit it in place.

These progresions are intended to be jseful to instructors (or for use in a possible viewing application, in the future). The ideal example set for stidents to browse after class is probably a smaller number of files, that differ in more ways from example to example.
